		<h4>About the site</h4>
		<p>I created this site as an outlet for new apps and tools that use statistics to help dota players get more from their game. Dota 2 has such a large user base (600,000+ people playing at any one time, and 12,000,000+ unique players in a month), that creating any useful app for the game is sure to be valuable.</p>
		<h4>About me</h4>
		<p>In Steam & Dota I go by <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/richmartel/">NoMercy</a>, but my actual name is <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RichMartel/about">Rich Martel</a> and I'm a <a href="http://richmartel.com">professional front-end software engineer</a>. I started this site after being laid-off from my job. I was looking for a way to keep my skills sharp while learning a new front-end framework (Angular 2) and working on a fun project.</p>
